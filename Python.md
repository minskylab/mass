Python is a multipurpose language with a deep focus in simplicity. That is.

**Wonders:**

* Giant ecosystem: a lot of people behind a lot of [awesome work](https://github.com/vinta/awesome-python).
* [Constant and interesting modernization](https://medium.com/@martin.heinz/new-features-in-python-3-9-you-should-know-about-14f3c647c2b4) .
* WSGI & [ASGI](https://asgi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) technology.
* [Machine Learning](https://github.com/josephmisiti/awesome-machine-learning#python) technology loves python.
* Easy science with: numpy, scipy, pandas, matplotlib, sympy, jupyter.
* Early access to new academic technology (e.g. [taichi](https://github.com/taichi-dev/taichi)).
