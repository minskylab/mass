# M.A.S.S
Minsky Agile Stack Strategy is a draft for a strategy to introduce a modern stack for software development and computational thinking to any interested people to acquire or improve their development toolkit.

## Minsky's Stack
Our stack have an important center in the open source and colaborative technology, we use modern tools in order to improve our ability in the software creation and how this software can be used to create more complex tools with which we can impact in our nation (at this stage).

Minsky's stack is a recopilation of the most interesting piece of software and concepts in the last years. Our stack isn't static or inmutable, quite the opossite, we need to improve and evolve constantly in the time, all the opinions or ideas are welcome.

* Python and JavaScript are both two necessary languages to know the basis of modern software development, each one have its own orientation, Python follows software composition and simplicity oriented development, and JavaScript is an ancestor of a lot of web and cloud modern technologies. BTW You can choose one or both, is your decision.
** QUIC is a relative new transport layer network protocol, HTTP over UDP or HTTP/3. Probably you want to search about this.
