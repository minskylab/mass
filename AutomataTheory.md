### What's an automaton?

It's an abstraction of machines with the computation capability, an automaton is a generalization of   state machines. We have 4 classes of automatons:

1. **Combinational Logic:** time independent logic, only depends of the input [[ref]](https://books.google.com.pe/books/about/Electronic_Design.html?id=uylVPgAACAAJ&redir_esc=y).
2. **Finite-State Machine:** the FSM can change from one state to another in response to some inputs; the change from one state to another is called a transition [[ref]](https://books.google.com.pe/books/about/Formal_Methods_in_Computer_Science.html?id=1VIiwQEACAAJ&redir_esc=y).
3. **Pushdown Automaton:** the power of the context. This automaton can use the top of the stack to decide which transition to take and it can manipulate the stack as part of performing a transition.
4. **Turing Machine:** is a mathematical model of computation that defines an abstract machine, which manipulates symbols on a strip of tape according to a table of rules.
