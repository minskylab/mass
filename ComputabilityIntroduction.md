# Computability

This section of our Learning Path is only a gentle and brief introduction to awesome topics: **Computability** and **Automata Theory**. Each one are very deep and transversal sciences but in this document we only define some concepts and refer util resources if you are more interested. The main goal is that you can make relations between this theoretical concepts and the modern software development.

## 1. What's computation and what's computable ?

    - What is a Turing Machine?
    - What can solve a Turing Machine?

## 2. What's an automata?

TODO


## 3. How now which algorithm is better? (Big O notation)

    - Sorting Algorithms
    - Data structures
    - Big O

## One snippet is worth hundred of words

```python
# TODO code
print("hello world")
```
